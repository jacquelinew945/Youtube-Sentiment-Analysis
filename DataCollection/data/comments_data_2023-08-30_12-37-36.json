The Ukrainian operator Kyivstar accidentally admitted to the real losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The operator launched a charity event - send a message with the word \"thank you\" to the number of a fallen soldier. \u201c400,000 heroes will never answer the phone again,\u201d they wrote in the promo. The video has now been removed.\nTotal mobilization coming in Ukraine: One of the main problems of the Ukrainian Army are the horrific losses on the battlefields. The meat grinder assaults during the months-long counteroffensive did not bring any significant victories, and the combat-ready units of the Armed Forces were ground down on the battlefield. In order to continue any effective military operations, Kyiv needs to increase mobilization throughout the country. At first, the German media reported that Ukraine needs to mobilize about 3 million people to win the war. Such reports were widely appreciated as a kind of instruction to Kyiv from NATO.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to various estimates, a total of no more than 10 million people remain in the country, and combat-ready aged men are already either at the front, in graves or have fled abroad. Kiev is unlikely to find the necessary number of new fighters. At the same time, the West has to find additional funds to provide them with training, food, weapons and payroll.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Kiev is already preparing the public for total mobilization. In February 2022, the Ukrainian authorities announced a general mobilization in the country. At the end of August, Zelensky said that the General Staff was asking for \u201can opportunity to mobilize more servicemen.\u201d The Head of the National Security Council made similar statements. Despite attempts to calm the population, mass mobilization continues throughout the country. Men are forcibly caught on the streets or in public places and enlisted in the military against their will. This often leads to clashes with civilians. Military commissars beat off women and children trying to save their loved ones.\r\n\r\nThe public anger is growing. Ukrainian military commissars have become the targets. In the Transcarpathian region, a sergeant who caught men and sent them to a meat grinder on the frontlines was found with a broken skull in the forest.\r\n\r\nWith or without any official public statement, Kyiv is preparing for a new wave of mass mobilization in autumn. All employees of military enlistment offices and military medical commissions were taken under tight control and banned from issuing deferrals and permits to leave the country. Pro-Russian hackers have published documents confirming that the military authorities have already obliged local state and commercial enterprises to provide lists of all their employees who are fit for duty.\r\n\r\nWhat is the most important is that Kyiv is mobilizing the population of the eastern and southern regions, which Kyiv nationalists in power consider to be widely pro-Russian. According to the documents, preparations for large-scale mobilization are being carried out in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, Zaporozhye and Mykolaiv regions.\r\n\r\nThese are the regions that the Kyiv regime is considering to be lost.

Instead, stick to logic and the truth, even if you personally don't like it.\nI must add that I personally do not sympathize with right-wing ideology at all and to refute your theory, I first heard about this song, not from right-wing influencers on social media, but in a Guardian article titled: \"The protest song that's taken America by storm hits too many false notes\". Then I checked the song and loved it because it is beautiful. And one other thing to give you some context, I was not able to listen to Jason Aldean or Luke Combs or Morgan Wallen songs even once.

This is just prolonging the abortion time, majority of abortions happen BY week 7, now because of all the hurtles woman are now having them BY week 13, and that\u2019s not because they are choosing too.  It\u2019s especially effecting the woman who HAVE to keep the pregnancy because they can\u2019t find ways threw all the new hurtles. (Examples: Finding a ride for travel, Finding time off work, Finding child care, Having enough to pay all expenses, etc.) So many people don\u2019t get that even for woman who WANT to be pregnant might need abortions, and if it\u2019s needed in the 3rd trimester are emergencies and are RARE. Having abortion accessible for ALL won\u2019t stop woman from having baby\u2019s, there is no shortage, there are plenty in the system but I\u2019ve always heard people shout it\u2019s about life, well yes the mothers life, the millions of baby\u2019s and children in the systems life\u2019s, it\u2019s unrealistic to assume majority of woman are both physically and mentally 100% healthy and capable of going threw with a pregnancy. (Also financially counts) The reality is all woman have their own individual health issues, forcing pregnancy on the hopes that they will be put up for foster care is insulting and immoral since you are risking the mothers life and well being and putting a fetus over her. Woman are more important than a fetus, if it wasn\u2019t for her the fetus couldn\u2019t be there in the first place. If the woman lives she still is the option to have a pregnancy in the future, but if the choice to abortion is taken that will rise the mortality rates killing both woman and fetus saving no one in the process, another thing hysterectomy\u2019s might see a huge rise as there is 0 chance of having any pregnancy after that. These insane laws are actually pushing more woman to choose between dying or giving up the option to conceive ever again and that\u2019s what will really bring down the numbers in population. Abortions save life\u2019s, nobody is helping woman by taking away abortion access. This IS about woman, I don\u2019t see why the argument is always \u201cwhat about the fetuses life\u201d well the fetus doesn\u2019t get a say over the woman, it\u2019s common sense, the topic is abortion, not when life begins or if the fetus is a human, because I\u2019ll state this now, From a biological standpoint, a fetus is human only in species. It is not a viable human being until a certain gestational age, others say not until it is born (yes it\u2019s a fact that doctors have deemed a baby already born as non viable and usually they don\u2019t survive past a couple hours/days). To address when life begins well some people say \u201ca new human being is formed at conception\u201d That is just their opinion and has no facts behind it, even science doesn\u2019t know when life actually starts. It is long pointed out that understanding what it is to be human requires a lot more than biology. And scientists can\u2019t establish when a fertilized cell or embryo or fetus becomes a human being. The overall point is that biology does not determine when human life begins. It is a question that can only be answered by appealing to our values, examining what we take to be human. Science has no answer but people can be entitled to their opinion, but opinions shouldn\u2019t override facts. Again the topic is abortion and it should be safe, legal, and accessible for ALL. \ud83d\udc4d", "like_count": 107, "published_at": "2022-06-10T17:16:52Z", "author": "Show Me Something"}, {"video_id": "v1_ilS5zku8", "comment_id": "Ugybe9HJYs6T6D8F3kJ4AaABAg", "text": "People say everybody is living in a \u2018free world\u2019 and with \u2018options\u2019 and \u2018choice\u2019.

Like who can really afford to have 5 kids nowadays plus a mortgage? Who will these homes really be for? Not the homeless that were born here and waiting for a place to live for years. \n\nThey just passed through rejected plans through appeal to build 14- 16 storey flats that is built next to a tiny stream that goes underground for miles. It has fish, shrimp and other wildlife like herons that nest there. This is also on a high flood risk plain that already floods. The boast of panoramic views, which is ironic for us folk who already live here and grow veg and rely on that daylight. \n\nI also wonder how much more noise it would create in a conservation area? It has already got noisier since they have started. A lot of the debated happened during covid, where no one could attend or voice their objections. \n\nThat guy is talking absolute bs! We need the water infrastructure in place to take that waste water, away from rivers and streams and put into proper sewage treatment facilities. All of that nitrate and phosphorus can be used in creating fertilisers.\n\nOnce it leaves the private property, the responsibility is down to the water companies, who probably don't even live here enough to give a damn about what happens to the waste. It is like they almost want us to go back to the days of open waste gulleys like they have in undeveloped countries.  \n\nRishi has thrown money at France to stop the didgy boats and target the people traffickers. This is clearly not working. He bought a barge to house illegal migrants but didn't think to test the water on board and check for tampering before boarding these people to stay. That whole Rwanda thing, where is the proof of money well spent? \n\nWe just received our water bill and it doesn't even state the meter reading they are using compared to actual reading as they haven't checked in months.  What made me go huh?, was there was a section on how much money i can save by redirecting my waste water into natural recourses... You mean like our local stream, with fish, shrimp, birds and other wildlife????? \n\nJust like the energy companies, the service charges have also gone up extranomically! \n\nI think more people will start to think for themselves, if a) nothing has improved over the coming winter months, that these water and b) energy suppliers don't announce new stations to cope with the new housing and ever increasing climate change.", "like_count": 3, "published_at": "2023-08-30T02:22:00Z", "author": "AnyKeyLady"}, {"video_id": "sSvD-E3-jas", "comment_id": "Ugy6rgHXlgquppEwxgh4AaABAg", "text": "Corruption!", "like_count": 13, "published_at": "2023-08-29T20:56:03Z", "author": "Terasci"}, {"video_id": "sSvD-E3-jas", "comment_id": "Ugx-ITOnbYAgW2Orr9V4AaABAg", "text": "The houses getting built are thrown up for the most part and extremely compact", "like_count": 3, "published_at": "2023-08-29T21:34:36Z", "author": "Stephen Bermingham"}, {"video_id": "sSvD-E3-jas", "comment_id": "UgwHa7ZNZvEvPBA8wOd4AaABAg", "text": "as long as all these new housing estates have some character and are not copy and paste jobs.
